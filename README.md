# Moisture-Sensor-Data-Collection
2023 Capstone project

## Introduction

My project uses hardware and software components to read & analyze data from a moisture sensor. It is meant to be used to monitor the status of house plants. 

## Hardware Details
- Raspberry pi: connected to power via USB-C
- Arduino: Connected to Pi via USB-B
- Moisture sensor: Inserted in soil and connected to Arduino via jumper cables

## Software Details
- Python: Used mariadb, matplotlib, and numpy libraries. Also used standard libraries such as time and serial
- SQL: Used simple SELECT and INSERT statements in MySQL workbench
- Bash: Set up Maria DB on a Debian 10 VPS. Used TMUX to have script run while terminal was closed
